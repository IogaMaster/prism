#### Why?

I have many wallpapers, finding ones I like that are in the colorscheme I am using is a pain.
Recoloring them manually is also time consuming. So I made this module to do it for me.
Hopefully it's useful to you as well!

## üì¶ Installation and Usage

Include in your flake
```nix
inputs.prism.url = "github:IogaMaster/prism";
```

Include the `prism.homeModules.prism` module the way you like.

> \[!NOTE\]\
> If you add or remove an image from the wallpapers path, ALL wallpapers will be rebuilt.
>
> Depending on the number and resolution of wallpapers, switching to a new generation can take a long time.

Here are all the colorschemes:
https://github.com/ozwaldorf/lutgen-rs/blob/main/palettes/palettes.json

To use `Gruvbox Dark` you need to specify `colorscheme = "gruvbox-dark";`

Using the module:
```nix
prism = {
  enable = true;
  wallpapers = ./wallpapers; # Path to the wallpapers directory in your config. (IMAGES ONLY)
  outPath = ".config/wallpapers"; # Where in your home directory to output to.

  # There are a few different ways of setting the colorscheme.

  # If you pass the name it will use a lutgen builtin scheme
  colorscheme = "catppuccin-mocha"; 
  
  # If you pass a list of colors, it will build a scheme from them. 
  # They are formatted like base16 schemes
  # colorscheme = [ "FFFFFF" "FAFAFA" ... ]; 
 
  # You can also pass a nix-colors scheme attrset and it will parse the colors.
  # colorscheme = nix-colors.colorscheme.nord;
};
```
